----------
* more sane way to specify nested parameters (honestly, I don't know what I was thinking before)
* the old method of specifying nested parameters ("user/first_name", "user/last_name") DOES NOT WORK ANYMORE.
* changed param_protected/param_accessible's :exclude argument to :except to better fit in with Rails

----------
* rewrote the entire plugin (it should actually work now)
